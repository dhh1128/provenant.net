<p>Unsolicited calls from questionable sources are rife. We answer scammers or telemarketers during work meetings and family events, and feel victimized.</p>
<p>Regulators expect carriers to fix this. But caller ID is iffy. Maybe the caller's phone number is in a database, but the number can be faked...</p>
<p>Provenant's Origin platform changes this. Every call gets a cryptographically verifiable origin. This doesn't just prove who called; it proves where their business is registered, and what kind of business it is.</p>
<p class="summary">Goodbye, robocalls. Hello, <em>authentic digital communication</em>.</p>

    <div id="slide-2">
<p>Emails say they're from our bank, our government, or our service provider. They have the right logo. They say the right things. But who really sent them?</p>
<p>Provenant's Origin platform answers this question. Every email gets a cryptographically verifiable origin. The sender of the email can't fake their identity.</p>
<p class="summary">Goodbye, phishing. Hello, <em>authentic digital communication</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="slide-3">
<p>A text warns that our account has been compromised; we must log in right away, at the conveniently included link, to reset our password!</p>
<p>Provenant's Origin platform makes sure such texts are flagged as a scam. Every text gets a cryptographically verifiable origin. This holds the original sender, as well as intermediaries in the telecom delivery pipeline, accountable.</p>
<p class="summary">Goodbye, smishing. Hello, <em>authentic digital communication</em>.</p>

    <div id="slide-4">
<p>A company posts their latest financial report. The numbers are surprising, and their website had a strange outage that might indicate hacking. Is the report trustworthy?</p>
<p>Provenant's Origin platform makes signing and verification of whole documents, or individual facts in documents, easy. Every signed document becomes tamper-proof, with a cryptographically verifiable origin. The author and attestors are known with certainty.</p>
<p class="summary">Goodbye, questionable documents. Hello, <em>authentic digital communication</em>.</p>

    <div id="slide-5">
<p>An online news article quotes a famous personality saying something outrageous. There's video to prove the statement actually happened. But is the video real, or a deep fake? Does the journalist cite sources carefully, in a verifiable chain of evidence?</p>
<p>Provenant's Origin platform makes content and citations verifiable. Every fact can be linked to its source, and content becomes tamper-proof. The content can be linked strongly to the public, non-repudiable reputation of its original creators.</p>
